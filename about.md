I'm a postdoctoral researcher with [Dr. Boris Worm](http://wormlab.biology.dal.ca/about/who-are-we/dr-boris-worm/) in the Department of Biology at [Dalhousie University](http://www.dal.ca/), Halifax, Canada. 

I am particularly interested in understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics governing interactions between fish and fishers and how these can be better predicted and managed in a changing environment. 

My current work focus on developing hierarchical dynamic models to fisheries bycatch from at-sea observer data in order to better understand environmental and fishery-related drivers of bycatch. I am also exploring simulation-based analysis to evaluate different management options and effects on bycatch levels. 

In my PhD [dissertation](http://dalspace.library.dal.ca/handle/10222/56282), I used Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal models fitted with the Integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) â€“ a relatively new approach to fast statistical inference for latent Gaussian Markov random field. I had the great pleasure to spend 6 months with the developer of [R-INLA](http://www.r-inla.org/) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in the Department of Mathematical Sciences with [Dr. Havard Rue](http://www.math.ntnu.no/~hrue/), where I learned many of the INLA quirks.
